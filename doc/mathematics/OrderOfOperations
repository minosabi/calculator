Operations
"Operations" mean things like add, subtract, multiply, divide, squaring, etc. If it isn't a stringValue it is probably an operation.

But, when you see something like...

7 + (6 × 52 + 3)

... what part should you calculate first?

Start at the left and go to the right?
Or go from right to left?

Warning: Calculate them in the wrong order, and you will get a wrong answer !

So, long ago people agreed to follow rules when doing calculations, and they are:

Order of Operations
Do things in Brackets First

yes	 	6 × (5 + 3)	=	6 × 8	=	48

not	 	6 × (5 + 3)	=	30 + 3	=	33(wrong)

Exponents (Powers, Roots) before Multiply, Divide, Add or Subtract

yes	 	5 × 22	=	5 × 4	=	20

not	 	5 × 22	=	102	=	100(wrong)

Multiply or Divide before you Add or Subtract

yes	 	2 + 5 × 3	=	2 + 15	=	17

not	 	2 + 5 × 3	=	7 × 3	=	21(wrong)

Otherwise just go left to right

yes	 	30 ÷ 5 × 3	=	6 × 3	=	18

not	 	30 ÷ 5 × 3	=	30 ÷ 15	=	2(wrong)

How Do I Remember It All ... ? BODMAS !

B
Brackets first

O
Orders (i.e. Powers and Square Roots, etc.)

DM
Division and Multiplication (left-to-right)

AS
Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)

Divide and Multiply rank equally (and go left to right).

Add and Subtract rank equally (and go left to right)

So do it this way:

bodmas
After you have done "B" and "O", just go from left to right doing any "D" or "M" as you find them.

Then go from left to right doing any "A" or "S" as you find them.

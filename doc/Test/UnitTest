
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class) is used to provide a bridge between Spring Boot test
features and JUnit. Whenever we are using any Spring Boot testing features in out JUnit
tests, this annotation will be required.

Provide your test with @ContextConfiguration(classes = ClassToAutowire.class), then
your context will be provided with that class.

@SpringBootTest annotation is used in Integration Tests to load full context.
With @ContextConfiguration annotation you are available to load only part of context.


@SpringBootTest is used for integration tests that's mean integrating different layers of
the application. This is why it loads the whole context.

If you want to unit test only controllers, use @WebMvcTest and mock all the other layers
that you need.

For full unit tests of all the layers with working examples see: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-testing
